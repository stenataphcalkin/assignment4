## Goals
### Base levels
-   🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
-   🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes: Responsive Design or  `media queries`.
-   🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
-   🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
-   🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
### Stretch goals
-   🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.
-   🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.
-   🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.
-   🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.


## Troubleshooting:

Digimon > localhost8080:Digimon > Digimon
Again with trying to define the style sheet, for some reason I had to copy and paste the code in as, no changes, and it decided it would work again. Have refreshed the colours several times to be sure it works.
Vite decided it no longer wanted to be a thing on Friday after lunch, and had to reinstall.
